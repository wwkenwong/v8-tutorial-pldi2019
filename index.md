## Using the V8 as a Research Platform

In this tutorial we will give an overview over the JavaScript and WebAssembly virtual machine V8. In particular, we will look into the JavaScript runtime system, the parsing and compilation architecture, garbage collection, WebAssembly and web benchmarking with workloads and metrics. The main goal of this tutorial is to make V8 approachable for researchers, brainstorm ideas about how V8 could be more hackable, and discuss virtual machine research problems and ideas.

**Date:** June 22nd, 2019

**Time:** Afternoon session (starting at 2PM)

**Duration:** half day
